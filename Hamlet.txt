1     I,2,267 [aside] A little more than kin, and less than kind!
2     I,2,269 Not so, my lord. I am too much i' th' sun.
3     I,2,276 Ay, madam, it is common.
4     I,2,279 Seems, madam, Nay, it is. I know not 'seems.' 'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,...
5     I,2,323 I shall in all my best obey you, madam.
6

I,2,333

O that this too too solid flesh would melt,
Thaw, and resolve itself into a dew!...

7

I,2,366

I am glad to see you well.
Horatio!- or I do forget myself.

8

I,2,369

Sir, my good friend- I'll change that name with you.
And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio?...

9

I,2,373

I am very glad to see you.- [To Bernardo] Good even, sir.-
But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?

10

I,2,376

I would not hear your enemy say so,
Nor shall you do my ear that violence...

11

I,2,383

I prithee do not mock me, fellow student.
I think it was to see my mother's wedding.

12

I,2,386

Thrift, thrift, Horatio! The funeral bak'd meats
Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables....

13

I,2,392

In my mind's eye, Horatio.

14

I,2,394

He was a man, take him for all in all.
I shall not look upon his like again.

15

I,2,397

Saw? who?

16

I,2,399

The King my father?

17

I,2,404

For God's love let me hear!

18

I,2,422

But where was this?

19

I,2,424

Did you not speak to it?

20

I,2,432

'Tis very strange.

21

I,2,436

Indeed, indeed, sirs. But this troubles me.
Hold you the watch to-night?

22

I,2,439

Arm'd, say you?

23

I,2,441

From top to toe?

24

I,2,443

Then saw you not his face?

25

I,2,445

What, look'd he frowningly.

26

I,2,447

Pale or red?

27

I,2,449

And fix'd his eyes upon you?

28

I,2,451

I would I had been there.

29

I,2,453

Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?

30

I,2,457

His beard was grizzled- no?

31

I,2,460

I will watch to-night.
Perchance 'twill walk again.

32

I,2,463

If it assume my noble father's person,
I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape...

33

I,2,474

Your loves, as mine to you. Farewell.
[Exeunt [all but Hamlet].]...

34

I,4,626

The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.

35

I,4,628

What hour now?

36

I,4,635

The King doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,
Keeps wassail, and the swagg'ring upspring reels,...

37

I,4,641

Ay, marry, is't;
But to my mind, though I am native here...

38

I,4,668

Angels and ministers of grace defend us!
Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,...

39

I,4,695

It will not speak. Then will I follow it.

40

I,4,697

Why, what should be the fear?
I do not set my life at a pin's fee;...

41

I,4,712

It waves me still.
Go on. I'll follow thee.

42

I,4,715

Hold off your hands!

43

I,4,717

My fate cries out
And makes each petty artire in this body...

44

I,5,733

Whither wilt thou lead me? Speak! I'll go no further.

45

I,5,735

I will.

46

I,5,739

Alas, poor ghost!

47

I,5,742

Speak. I am bound to hear.

48

I,5,744

What?

49

I,5,760

O God!

50

I,5,762

Murther?

51

I,5,765

Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift
As meditation or the thoughts of love,...

52

I,5,778

O my prophetic soul!
My uncle?

53

I,5,818

O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!

54

I,5,830

O all you host of heaven! O earth! What else?
And shall I couple hell? Hold, hold, my heart!...

55

I,5,855

So be it!

56

I,5,857

Hillo, ho, ho, boy! Come, bird, come.

57

I,5,862

No, you will reveal it.

58

I,5,865

How say you then? Would heart of man once think it?
But you'll be secret?

59

I,5,868

There's neer a villain dwelling in all Denmark
But he's an arrant knave.

60

I,5,872

Why, right! You are in the right!
And so, without more circumstance at all,...

61

I,5,880

I am sorry they offend you, heartily;
Yes, faith, heartily.

62

I,5,883

Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,
And much offence too. Touching this vision here,...

63

I,5,891

Never make known what you have seen to-night.

64

I,5,893

Nay, but swear't.

65

I,5,897

Upon my sword.

66

I,5,899

Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.

67

I,5,902

Aha boy, say'st thou so? Art thou there, truepenny?
Come on! You hear this fellow in the cellarage....

68

I,5,906

Never to speak of this that you have seen.
Swear by my sword.

69

I,5,909

Hic et ubique? Then we'll shift our ground.
Come hither, gentlemen,...

70

I,5,915

Well said, old mole! Canst work i' th' earth so fast?
A worthy pioner! Once more remove, good friends."

71

I,5,918

And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.
There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,...

72

I,5,937

Rest, rest, perturbed spirit! So, gentlemen,
With all my love I do commend me to you;...

73

II,2,1277

Well, God-a-mercy.

74

II,2,1279

Excellent well. You are a fishmonger.

75

II,2,1281

Then I would you were so honest a man.

76

II,2,1283

Ay, sir. To be honest, as this world goes, is to be one man
pick'd out of ten thousand.

77

II,2,1286

For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a god
kissing carrion- Have you a daughter?

78

II,2,1289

Let her not walk i' th' sun. Conception is a blessing, but not
as your daughter may conceive. Friend, look to't.

79

II,2,1296

Words, words, words.

80

II,2,1298

Between who?

81

II,2,1300

Slanders, sir; for the satirical rogue says here that old men
have grey beards; that their faces are wrinkled; their eyes...

82

II,2,1309

Into my grave?

83

II,2,1316

You cannot, sir, take from me anything that I will more
willingly part withal- except my life, except my life, except my...

84

II,2,1321

These tedious old fools!

85

II,2,1327

My excellent good friends! How dost thou, Guildenstern? Ah,
Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do ye both?

86

II,2,1332

Nor the soles of her shoe?

87

II,2,1334

Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of her
favours?

88

II,2,1337

In the secret parts of Fortune? O! most true! she is a
strumpet. What news ?

89

II,2,1340

Then is doomsday near! But your news is not true. Let me
question more in particular. What have you, my good friends,...

90

II,2,1345

Denmark's a prison.

91

II,2,1347

A goodly one; in which there are many confines, wards, and
dungeons, Denmark being one o' th' worst.

92

II,2,1350

Why, then 'tis none to you; for there is nothing either good
or bad but thinking makes it so. To me it is a prison.

93

II,2,1354

O God, I could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a
king of infinite space, were it not that I have bad dreams.

94

II,2,1358

A dream itself is but a shadow.

95

II,2,1361

Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and outstretch'd
heroes the beggars' shadows. Shall we to th' court? for, by my...

96

II,2,1365

No such matter! I will not sort you with the rest of my
servants; for, to speak to you like an honest man, I am most...

97

II,2,1370

Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I thank you;
and sure, dear friends, my thanks are too dear a halfpenny. Were...

98

II,2,1375

Why, anything- but to th' purpose. You were sent for; and
there is a kind of confession in your looks, which your modesties...

99

II,2,1380

That you must teach me. But let me conjure you by the rights
of our fellowship, by the consonancy of our youth, by the...

100

II,2,1386

[aside] Nay then, I have an eye of you.- If you love me, hold
not off.

101

II,2,1389

I will tell you why. So shall my anticipation prevent your
discovery, and your secrecy to the King and Queen moult no...

102

II,2,1405

Why did you laugh then, when I said 'Man delights not me'?

103

II,2,1409

He that plays the king shall be welcome- his Majesty shall
have tribute of me; the adventurous knight shall use his foil and...

104

II,2,1418

How chances it they travel? Their residence, both in
reputation and profit, was better both ways.

105

II,2,1422

Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was in the
city? Are they so follow'd?

106

II,2,1425

How comes it? Do they grow rusty?

107

II,2,1432

What, are they children? Who maintains 'em? How are they
escoted? Will they pursue the quality no longer than they can...

108

II,2,1442

Is't possible?

109

II,2,1444

Do the boys carry it away?

110

II,2,1446

It is not very strange; for my uncle is King of Denmark, and
those that would make mows at him while my father lived give...

111

II,2,1453

Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands, come! Th'
appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony. Let me comply...

112

II,2,1460

I am but mad north-north-west. When the wind is southerly I
know a hawk from a handsaw.

113

II,2,1464

Hark you, Guildenstern- and you too- at each ear a hearer!
That great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling...

114

II,2,1469

I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players. Mark it.-
You say right, sir; a Monday morning; twas so indeed.

115

II,2,1472

My lord, I have news to tell you. When Roscius was an actor in Rome-

116

II,2,1474

Buzz, buzz!

117

II,2,1476

Then came each actor on his ass-

118

II,2,1483

O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!

119

II,2,1485

Why,
'One fair daughter, and no more,...

120

II,2,1489

Am I not i' th' right, old Jephthah?

121

II,2,1492

Nay, that follows not.

122

II,2,1494

Why,
'As by lot, God wot,'...

123

II,2,1512

I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was never acted;
or if it was, not above once; for the play, I remember, pleas'd...

124

II,2,1573

It shall to the barber's, with your beard.- Prithee say on.
He's for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he sleeps. Say on; come to...

125

II,2,1577

'The mobled queen'?

126

II,2,1595

'Tis well. I'll have thee speak out the rest of this soon.-
Good my lord, will you see the players well bestow'd? Do you...

127

II,2,1601

God's bodykins, man, much better! Use every man after his
desert, and who should scape whipping? Use them after your own...

128

II,2,1606

Follow him, friends. We'll hear a play to-morrow.
[Exeunt Polonius and Players [except the First].]...

129

II,2,1611

We'll ha't to-morrow night. You could, for a need, study a
speech of some dozen or sixteen lines which I would set down and...

130

II,2,1615

Very well. Follow that lord- and look you mock him not.
[Exit First Player.]...

131

II,2,1620

Ay, so, God b' wi' ye!
[Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern]...

132

III,1,1749

To be, or not to be- that is the question:
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer...

133

III,1,1786

I humbly thank you; well, well, well.

134

III,1,1790

No, not I!
I never gave you aught.

135

III,1,1798

Ha, ha! Are you honest?

136

III,1,1800

Are you fair?

137

III,1,1802

That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should admit no
discourse to your beauty.

138

III,1,1805

Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner transform
honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can...

139

III,1,1810

You should not have believ'd me; for virtue cannot so
inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it. I loved you...

140

III,1,1814

Get thee to a nunnery! Why wouldst thou be a breeder of
sinners? I am myself indifferent honest, but yet I could accuse...

141

III,1,1824

Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the fool
nowhere but in's own house. Farewell.

142

III,1,1827

If thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague for thy dowry:
be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not escape...

143

III,1,1834

I have heard of your paintings too, well enough. God hath
given you one face, and you make yourselves another. You jig, you...

144

III,2,1883

Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounc'd it to you,
trippingly on the tongue. But if you mouth it, as many of our...

145

III,2,1896

Be not too tame neither; but let your own discretion be your
tutor. Suit the action to the word, the word to the action; with...

146

III,2,1914

O, reform it altogether! And let those that play your clowns
speak no more than is set down for them. For there be of them...

147

III,2,1925

Bid the players make haste, [Exit Polonius.] Will you two
help to hasten them?

148

III,2,1929

What, ho, Horatio!

149

III,2,1932

Horatio, thou art e'en as just a man
As e'er my conversation cop'd withal.

150

III,2,1935

Nay, do not think I flatter;
For what advancement may I hope from thee,...

151

III,2,1973

They are coming to the play. I must be idle.
Get you a place.

152

III,2,1976

Excellent, i' faith; of the chameleon's dish. I eat the air,
promise-cramm'd. You cannot feed capons so.

153

III,2,1980

No, nor mine now. [To Polonius] My lord, you play'd once
i' th' university, you say?

154

III,2,1983

What did you enact?

155

III,2,1986

It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf there. Be
the players ready.

156

III,2,1990

No, good mother. Here's metal more attractive.

157

III,2,1992

Lady, shall I lie in your lap?

158

III,2,1995

I mean, my head upon your lap?

159

III,2,1997

Do you think I meant country matters?

160

III,2,1999

That's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs.

161

III,2,2001

Nothing.

162

III,2,2003

Who, I?

163

III,2,2005

O God, your only jig-maker! What should a man do but be merry?
For look you how cheerfully my mother looks, and my father died...

164

III,2,2009

So long? Nay then, let the devil wear black, for I'll have a
suit of sables. O heavens! die two months ago, and not forgotten...

165

III,2,2030

Marry, this is miching malhecho; it means mischief.

166

III,2,2033

We shall know by this fellow. The players cannot keep counsel;
they'll tell all.

167

III,2,2036

Ay, or any show that you'll show him. Be not you asham'd to
show, he'll not shame to tell you what it means.

168

III,2,2042

Is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring?

169

III,2,2044

As woman's love.

170

III,2,2073

[aside] Wormwood, wormwood!
Queen. The instances that second marriage move...

171

III,2,2116

If she should break it now!

172

III,2,2124

Madam, how like you this play?

173

III,2,2126

O, but she'll keep her word.

174

III,2,2128

No, no! They do but jest, poison in jest; no offence i' th'
world.

175

III,2,2131

'The Mousetrap.' Marry, how? Tropically. This play is the
image of a murther done in Vienna. Gonzago is the duke's name;...

176

III,2,2139

I could interpret between you and your love, if I could see
the puppets dallying.

177

III,2,2142

It would cost you a groaning to take off my edge.

178

III,2,2144

So you must take your husbands.- Begin, murtherer. Pox, leave
thy damnable faces, and begin! Come, the croaking raven doth...

179

III,2,2149

He poisons him i' th' garden for's estate. His name's Gonzago.
The story is extant, and written in very choice Italian. You...

180

III,2,2153

What, frighted with false fire?

181

III,2,2159

Why, let the strucken deer go weep,
The hart ungalled play;...

182

III,2,2167

A whole one I!
For thou dost know, O Damon dear,...

183

III,2,2173

O good Horatio, I'll take the ghost's word for a thousand
pound! Didst perceive?

184

III,2,2176

Upon the talk of the poisoning?

185

III,2,2178

Aha! Come, some music! Come, the recorders!
For if the King like not the comedy,...

186

III,2,2184

Sir, a whole history.

187

III,2,2186

Ay, sir, what of him?

188

III,2,2188

With drink, sir?

189

III,2,2190

Your wisdom should show itself more richer to signify this to
the doctor; for me to put him to his purgation would perhaps...

190

III,2,2195

I am tame, sir; pronounce.

191

III,2,2198

You are welcome.

192

III,2,2203

Sir, I cannot.

193

III,2,2205

Make you a wholesome answer; my wit's diseas'd. But, sir, such
answer as I can make, you shall command; or rather, as you say,...

194

III,2,2211

O wonderful son, that can so stonish a mother! But is there no
sequel at the heels of this mother's admiration? Impart.

195

III,2,2214

We shall obey, were she ten times our mother. Have you any
further trade with us?

196

III,2,2217

And do still, by these pickers and stealers!

197

III,2,2221

Sir, I lack advancement.

198

III,2,2224

Ay, sir, but 'while the grass grows'- the proverb is something
musty....

199

III,2,2231

I do not well understand that. Will you play upon this pipe?

200

III,2,2233

I pray you.

201

III,2,2235

I do beseech you.

202

III,2,2237

It is as easy as lying. Govern these ventages with your
fingers and thumbs, give it breath with your mouth, and it will...

203

III,2,2242

Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of me! You
would play upon me; you would seem to know my stops; you would...

204

III,2,2253

Do you see yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a camel?

205

III,2,2255

Methinks it is like a weasel.

206

III,2,2257

Or like a whale.

207

III,2,2259

Then will I come to my mother by-and-by.- They fool me to the
top of my bent.- I will come by-and-by.

208

III,2,2262

'By-and-by' is easily said.- Leave me, friends.
[Exeunt all but Hamlet.]...

209

III,3,2356

Now might I do it pat, now he is praying;
And now I'll do't. And so he goes to heaven,...

210

III,4,2388

[within] Mother, mother, mother!

211

III,4,2392

Now, mother, what's the matter?

212

III,4,2394

Mother, you have my father much offended.

213

III,4,2396

Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue.

214

III,4,2398

What's the matter now?

215

III,4,2400

No, by the rood, not so!
You are the Queen, your husband's brother's wife,...

216

III,4,2404

Come, come, and sit you down. You shall not budge;
You go not till I set you up a glass...

217

III,4,2410

[draws] How now? a rat? Dead for a ducat, dead!

218

III,4,2414

Nay, I know not. Is it the King?

219

III,4,2416

A bloody deed- almost as bad, good mother,
As kill a king, and marry with his brother.

220

III,4,2419

Ay, lady, it was my word.
[Lifts up the arras and sees Polonius.]...

221

III,4,2431

Such an act
That blurs the grace and blush of modesty;...

222

III,4,2445

Look here upon th's picture, and on this,
The counterfeit presentment of two brothers....

223

III,4,2485

Nay, but to live
In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,...

224

III,4,2492

A murtherer and a villain!
A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe...

225

III,4,2500

A king of shreds and patches!-
Save me and hover o'er me with your wings,...

226

III,4,2504

Do you not come your tardy son to chide,
That, laps'd in time and passion, lets go by...

227

III,4,2514

How is it with you, lady?

228

III,4,2524

On him, on him! Look you how pale he glares!
His form and cause conjoin'd, preaching to stones,...

229

III,4,2531

Do you see nothing there?

230

III,4,2533

Nor did you nothing hear?

231

III,4,2535

Why, look you there! Look how it steals away!
My father, in his habit as he liv'd!...

232

III,4,2542

Ecstasy?
My pulse as yours doth temperately keep time...

233

III,4,2560

O, throw away the worser part of it,
And live the purer with the other half,...

234

III,4,2585

Not this, by no means, that I bid you do:
Let the bloat King tempt you again to bed;...

235

III,4,2604

I must to England; you know that?

236

III,4,2607

There's letters seal'd; and my two schoolfellows,
Whom I will trust as I will adders fang'd,...

237

IV,2,2677

Safely stow'd.

238

IV,2,2679

But soft! What noise? Who calls on Hamlet? O, here they

239

IV,2,2683

Compounded it with dust, whereto 'tis kin.

240

IV,2,2686

Do not believe it.

241

IV,2,2688

That I can keep your counsel, and not mine own. Besides, to be
demanded of a sponge, what replication should be made by the son...

242

IV,2,2692

Ay, sir; that soaks up the King's countenance, his rewards,
his authorities. But such officers do the King best service in...

243

IV,2,2699

I am glad of it. A knavish speech sleeps in a foolish ear.

244

IV,2,2702

The body is with the King, but the King is not with the body.
The King is a thing-

245

IV,2,2705

Of nothing. Bring me to him. Hide fox, and all after.

246

IV,3,2729

At supper.

247

IV,3,2731

Not where he eats, but where he is eaten. A certain
convocation of politic worms are e'en at him. Your worm is your...

248

IV,3,2738

A man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a king, and eat
of the fish that hath fed of that worm.

249

IV,3,2741

Nothing but to show you how a king may go a progress through
the guts of a beggar.

250

IV,3,2744

In heaven. Send thither to see. If your messenger find him not
there, seek him i' th' other place yourself. But indeed, if you...

251

IV,3,2749

He will stay till you come.

252

IV,3,2758

For England?

253

IV,3,2760

Good.

254

IV,3,2762

I see a cherub that sees them. But come, for England!
Farewell, dear mother.

255

IV,3,2765

My mother! Father and mother is man and wife; man and wife is
one flesh; and so, my mother. Come, for England!

256

IV,4,2796

Good sir, whose powers are these?

257

IV,4,2798

How purpos'd, sir, I pray you?

258

IV,4,2800

Who commands them, sir?

259

IV,4,2802

Goes it against the main of Poland, sir,
Or for some frontier?

260

IV,4,2810

Why, then the Polack never will defend it.

261

IV,4,2812

Two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats
Will not debate the question of this straw....

262

IV,4,2819

I'll be with you straight. Go a little before.
[Exeunt all but Hamlet.]...

263

V,1,3407

Has this fellow no feeling of his business, that he sings at
grave-making?

264

V,1,3410

'Tis e'en so. The hand of little employment hath the daintier
sense.

265

V,1,3418

That skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once. How the
knave jowls it to the ground,as if 'twere Cain's jawbone, that...

266

V,1,3424

Or of a courtier, which could say 'Good morrow, sweet lord!
How dost thou, good lord?' This might be my Lord Such-a-one, that...

267

V,1,3429

Why, e'en so! and now my Lady Worm's, chapless, and knock'd
about the mazzard with a sexton's spade. Here's fine revolution,...

268

V,1,3440

There's another. Why may not that be the skull of a lawyer?
Where be his quiddits now, his quillets, his cases, his tenures,...

269

V,1,3454

Is not parchment made of sheepskins?

270

V,1,3456

They are sheep and calves which seek out assurance in that. I
will speak to this fellow. Whose grave's this, sirrah?

271

V,1,3461

I think it be thine indeed, for thou liest in't.

272

V,1,3464

Thou dost lie in't, to be in't and say it is thine. 'Tis for
the dead, not for the quick; therefore thou liest.

273

V,1,3467

What man dost thou dig it for?

274

V,1,3469

What woman then?

275

V,1,3471

Who is to be buried in't?

276

V,1,3473

How absolute the knave is! We must speak by the card, or
equivocation will undo us. By the Lord, Horatio, this three years...

277

V,1,3480

How long is that since?

278

V,1,3484

Ay, marry, why was be sent into England?

279

V,1,3487

Why?

280

V,1,3490

How came he mad?

281

V,1,3492

How strangely?

282

V,1,3494

Upon what ground?

283

V,1,3497

How long will a man lie i' th' earth ere he rot?

284

V,1,3502

Why he more than another?

285

V,1,3507

Whose was it?

286

V,1,3509

Nay, I know not.

287

V,1,3513

This?

288

V,1,3515

Let me see. [Takes the skull.] Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him,
Horatio. A fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy. He...

289

V,1,3527

Dost thou think Alexander look'd o' this fashion i' th' earth?

290

V,1,3529

And smelt so? Pah!

291

V,1,3532

To what base uses we may return, Horatio! Why may not
imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander till he find it...

292

V,1,3536

No, faith, not a jot; but to follow him thither with modesty
enough, and likelihood to lead it; as thus: Alexander died,...

293

V,1,3555

That is Laertes,
A very noble youth. Mark.

294

V,1,3577

What, the fair Ophelia?

295

V,1,3593

[comes forward] What is he whose grief
Bears such an emphasis? whose phrase of sorrow...

296

V,1,3600

Thou pray'st not well.
I prithee take thy fingers from my throat;...

297

V,1,3610

Why, I will fight with him upon this theme
Until my eyelids will no longer wag.

298

V,1,3613

I lov'd Ophelia. Forty thousand brothers
Could not (with all their quantity of love)...

299

V,1,3618

'Swounds, show me what thou't do.
Woo't weep? woo't fight? woo't fast? woo't tear thyself?...

300

V,1,3634

Hear you, sir!
What is the reason that you use me thus?...

301

V,2,3650

So much for this, sir; now shall you see the other.
You do remember all the circumstance?

302

V,2,3653

Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting
That would not let me sleep. Methought I lay...

303

V,2,3662

Up from my cabin,
My sea-gown scarf'd about me, in the dark...

304

V,2,3677

Here's the commission; read it at more leisure.
But wilt thou bear me how I did proceed?

305

V,2,3680

Being thus benetted round with villanies,
Or I could make a prologue to my brains,...

306

V,2,3690

An earnest conjuration from the King,
As England was his faithful tributary,...

307

V,2,3701

Why, even in that was heaven ordinant.
I had my father's signet in my purse,...

308

V,2,3710

Why, man, they did make love to this employment!
They are not near my conscience; their defeat...

309

V,2,3717

Does it not, thinks't thee, stand me now upon-
He that hath kill'd my king, and whor'd my mother;...

310

V,2,3727

It will be short; the interim is mine,
And a man's life is no more than to say 'one.'...

311

V,2,3738

I humbly thank you, sir. [Aside to Horatio] Dost know this
waterfly?

312

V,2,3741

[aside to Horatio] Thy state is the more gracious; for 'tis a
vice to know him. He hath much land, and fertile. Let a beast be...

313

V,2,3747

I will receive it, sir, with all diligence of spirit. Put your
bonnet to his right use. 'Tis for the head.

314

V,2,3750

No, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind is northerly.

315

V,2,3752

But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my complexion.

316

V,2,3756

I beseech you remember.

317

V,2,3764

Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you; though, I
know, to divide him inventorially would dozy th' arithmetic of...

318

V,2,3771

The concernancy, sir? Why do we wrap the gentleman in our more
rawer breath?

319

V,2,3776

What imports the nomination of this gentleman?

320

V,2,3780

Of him, sir.

321

V,2,3782

I would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did, it would not
much approve me. Well, sir?

322

V,2,3785

I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with him in
excellence; but to know a man well were to know himself.

323

V,2,3789

What's his weapon?

324

V,2,3791

That's two of his weapons- but well.

325

V,2,3798

What call you the carriages?

326

V,2,3802

The phrase would be more germane to the matter if we could
carry cannon by our sides. I would it might be hangers till then....

327

V,2,3811

How if I answer no?

328

V,2,3813

Sir, I will walk here in the hall. If it please his Majesty,
it is the breathing time of day with me. Let the foils be...

329

V,2,3819

To this effect, sir, after what flourish your nature will.

330

V,2,3821

Yours, yours. [Exit Osric.] He does well to commend it
himself; there are no tongues else for's turn.

331

V,2,3824

He did comply with his dug before he suck'd it. Thus has he,
and many more of the same bevy that I know the drossy age dotes...

332

V,2,3835

I am constant to my purposes; they follow the King's pleasure.
If his fitness speaks, mine is ready; now or whensoever, provided...

333

V,2,3839

In happy time.

334

V,2,3842

She well instructs me.

335

V,2,3845

I do not think so. Since he went into France I have been in
continual practice. I shall win at the odds. But thou wouldst not...

336

V,2,3849

It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of gaingiving as
would perhaps trouble a woman.

337

V,2,3853

Not a whit, we defy augury; there's a special providence in
the fall of a sparrow. If it be now, 'tis not to come; if it be...

338

V,2,3863

Give me your pardon, sir. I have done you wrong;
But pardon't, as you are a gentleman....

339

V,2,3891

I embrace it freely,
And will this brother's wager frankly play....

340

V,2,3895

I'll be your foil, Laertes. In mine ignorance
Your skill shall, like a star i' th' darkest night,...

341

V,2,3899

No, by this hand.

342

V,2,3902

Very well, my lord.
Your Grace has laid the odds o' th' weaker side.

343

V,2,3907

This likes me well. These foils have all a length?

344

V,2,3923

Come on, sir.

345

V,2,3925

One.

346

V,2,3927

Judgment!

347

V,2,3934

I'll play this bout first; set it by awhile.
Come. [They play.] Another hit. What say you?

348

V,2,3941

Good madam!

349

V,2,3945

I dare not drink yet, madam; by-and-by.

350

V,2,3950

Come for the third, Laertes! You but dally.
Pray you pass with your best violence;...

351

V,2,3958

Nay come! again! The Queen falls.

352

V,2,3963

How does the Queen?

353

V,2,3967

O villany! Ho! let the door be lock'd.
Treachery! Seek it out.

354

V,2,3978

The point envenom'd too?
Then, venom, to thy work. Hurts the King.

355

V,2,3982

Here, thou incestuous, murd'rous, damned Dane,
Drink off this potion! Is thy union here?...

356

V,2,3990

Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee.
I am dead, Horatio. Wretched queen, adieu!...

357

V,2,4002

As th'art a man,
Give me the cup. Let go! By heaven, I'll ha't....

358

V,2,4014

O, I die, Horatio!
The potent poison quite o'ercrows my spirit....
